# PUBLISH STEP ONLY — `make update-manifest`, never `make config`. This file is served live from
# disk by the onion site, and it describes builds that are actually downloadable. Regenerating it
# from a target every build depends on meant a version bump instantly announced a release that did
# not exist yet, offering the PREVIOUS release's APKs under the new number — hashes included, so
# the download verified and the user stayed on the old build, prompted forever. Run this after the
# new APKs are in website/applications/android/, and not before.
#
# The version comes from app/pubspec.yaml so it cannot drift from the
# released app, and each APK's sha256 is computed from the file actually being served, so the
# hash cannot drift from the bytes either. An APK that isn't present is simply omitted: the app
# then reports the update but offers no download, which is the right failure (tell the user
# something, promise nothing).
