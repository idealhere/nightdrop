/**
 * Two halves of the screenshot policy (#1), plus the Recents thumbnail fix.
 *
 * Screenshots are deliberately **allowed**. Blocking them with a permanent `FLAG_SECURE` only
 * pushes someone to photograph the screen with another phone, which no API can detect — so the
 * honest trade is to let the capture happen and make it *visible*: the app logs it and tells the
 * peer (see `Node::report_screenshot`).
 *
 * The Recents snapshot is different, and is blocked. Android snapshots the window when the activity
 * leaves the foreground, and that image sits in the task switcher for anyone who opens it — no
 * interaction, no unlock, and no user intent behind it.
 *
 * **API 33+ uses [setRecentsScreenshotEnabled], which is the tool built for exactly this**: the
 * system simply never snapshots the activity, and deliberate screenshots are untouched because
 * `FLAG_SECURE` is never involved. Set once, not toggled.
 *
 * Older releases fall back to holding `FLAG_SECURE` while backgrounded — added in `onPause`,
 * cleared in `onResume`. That fallback is **known to be unreliable**, which is why it is no longer
 * the main path: on a Galaxy S25 (Android 16) the thumbnail still showed the conversation, because
 * the system captures its snapshot as the transition begins and a flag set in `onPause` cannot
 * retroactively blank a frame already taken. Below API 33 there is nothing better available, so it
 * stays as a best effort rather than a guarantee.
 *
 * Detection is Android 14 (API 34) only. On anything older — and on desktop — a screenshot happens
 * silently, so the peer's silence is not evidence of anything. [CHANNEL]'s `canDetect` exists so the
 * Dart side can tell the user which of those two worlds they are in instead of implying a
 * guarantee.
